        <h1 id="how-to-use-block-comfor-latest-of-ascoos-cms">How to use Block <code>comfor-latest</code> of Ascoos Cms.</h1>
        <p>This tutorial is divided into four steps.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>What is <code>Comfor</code> program.</li>
        <li>Installing the <code>comfor-latest</code> Block</li>
        <li>Editing and configuration of its parameters.</li>
        <li>The result we have.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="1-what-is-comfor">1. What is <code>Comfor</code>.</h2>
        <p>Comfor is a discussion program integrated into Ascoos Cms and enables discussions with multilingual messages.</p>
        <p>Also, like all the programs in <strong>Ascoos CMS</strong>, it has the ability to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>change appearance through themes.</li>
        <li>display in the user's current language.</li>
        <li>Up to &quot;personalized&quot; access rights.</li>
        <li>... and much more.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the image below we see a view of the Comfor default theme.</p>

        <hr>
        <h2 id="1-installation">1. Installation</h2>
        <p>The first step is to install the Block on the <strong>Ascoos Cms</strong> website we have.</p>
        <p>Block is installed only through the built-in installer in the admin section.</p>
        <p>From the <strong>Ascoos Cms</strong> desktop, double-click the <code>Installation Program</code> icon you see in the image below.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="https://docs.ascoos.com/ascoos/ext/blocks/comfor-latest/images/scr-installer-000.webp"></p>
        <p>This will open us the installer, in which we will have to follow some easy steps to complete the installation of our block.</p>
        <h3 id="welcome">Welcome</h3>
        <p>First the program welcomes us to the installer, giving us some information about it and the installation process.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="https://docs.ascoos.com/ascoos/ext/blocks/comfor-latest/images/scr-installer-001-800.webp"></p>
        <h3 id="action-selection">Action Selection</h3>
        <p>Here we select the two action steps of the installer.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>In the first step, we select the action <code>Install</code>, thus declaring to the installer that we will do a <code>new installation</code>. In case our block is already installed and we just want to upgrade it then we will choose <code>Extension Upgrade</code>.
        In case we want to uninstall a component then we will select <code>Unistall</code>.
        The first option `ASCOOS Upgrade' is for kernel version upgrade.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>In the second action step, we choose the type of our extension.
        In our case here, we choose <code>Blocks</code>.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Then press the <code>Next</code> button to continue with the installation process.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="https://docs.ascoos.com/ascoos/ext/blocks/comfor-latest/images/scr-installer-002-800.webp"></p>
        <h3 id="select-installation-package">Select installation package</h3>
        <p>Here we are asked to select from our computer the compressed <code>zip</code> file containing the installation package.</p>
        <p>The program also informs us that the installation package should be certified by AlexSoft Software to have all the necessary security safeguards for your system.</p>
        <p>We press <code>Next</code> and since in this particular case we have no parameters that must be set during the installation process, the program will complete the installation.</p>
        <p>We will press the <code>Close</code> button at the end and we will finish our work with the installer.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="https://docs.ascoos.com/ascoos/ext/blocks/comfor-latest/images/scr-installer-003-800.webp"></p>
        <h1 id="edit-and-configure-the-block">Edit and configure the Block</h1>
        <p>On the <strong>Ascoos Cms</strong> desktop, double-click the <code>ASCOOS Explorer</code> icon to open the Ascoos component management program.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="https://docs.ascoos.com/ascoos/ext/blocks/comfor-latest/images/scr-ascoos-explorer-000.webp"></p>
        <p>In the program that will open (see image below) we choose:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>
        <p>From the menu ribbon the <code>Blocks</code> tab to go to the Blocks management page.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>we go to the <code>Views</code> section and from the drop-down named <code>Block</code> we select <code>comfor-latest</code>. This will show us in the list of blocks only the block with the title <code>Comfor Latest Messages</code>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>In the displayed list, click on <code>Comfor Latest Messages</code> to open our block for editing.</p>
        </li>
        </ol>
        <p align="center"><img src="https://docs.ascoos.com/ascoos/ext/blocks/comfor-latest/images/scr-block-comfor_latest-admin-0000-800.webp"></p>
        <h2 id="1-edit-the-basic-properties-of-the-block">1. Edit the basic properties of the Block.</h2>
        <p>All Blocks in Ascoos Cms have their basic settings the same from the start.</p>
        <p>From the editing page of the basic settings, we can adjust to the specific needs of each block, although the install.php file of our block's installation package takes care of presetting these specifics, as you can see in the image below.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="https://docs.ascoos.com/ascoos/ext/blocks/comfor-latest/images/scr-block-comfor_latest-admin-0002-basic-settings-800.webp"></p>
        <h3 id="lets-analyze-these-pieces-of-basic-settings-one-by-one">let's analyze these pieces of basic settings one by one.</h3>
        <ol>
        <li><code>BLOCK NAME</code>: Here we give the name our block will have. In addition to letters and numbers, we can also use the hyphen <code>-</code> and underscore hyphen <code>_</code>.
        <ul>
        <li><code>Block Name</code> : it is essentially the name of the copy of the physical block.</li>
        <li><code>Natural Block Name</code> : It is the natural name of the block as it is on the server disk. We can create as many copies of the block as we want. Of course, each one will have a different name.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        </ol>
        <p align="center"><img src="https://docs.ascoos.com/ascoos/ext/blocks/comfor-latest/images/scr-block-comfor_latest-admin-0004-basic-settings-block-name-800.webp"></p>
        <ol start="2">
        <li><code>BLOCK TITLE</code> : Here we can give multilingual titles to our block. Of course we can only in the languages supported by our website. We can add, remove and sort the titles as we wish.</li>
        </ol>
        <p align="center"><img src="https://docs.ascoos.com/ascoos/ext/blocks/comfor-latest/images/scr-block-comfor_latest-admin-0005-basic-settings-block-title-800.webp"></p>
        <ol start="3">
        <li>
        <p><code>VIEW OPTIONS</code> : Here we define the display parameters of the block.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p><code>Envirenment</code> : The environment that will be displayed. e.g. in the image below, we tell it to appear in the foreground of the webpage. It could be set to appear in the admin section, newsletter, etc.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><code>3LT Template (Front)</code> : Each Ascoos Template consists of 3 layers, <code>front</code>, <code>frontpage</code> and <code>efp (encapsulation frontpage)</code>.<code>front</code> is the main part of the template and does not change.
        Within this the two other layers listed below can appear, but only a frontpage. While we can embed multiple <code>efp</code>.
        With the technology of 3LT Template, `Ascoos Cms', gives the possibility to adjust from page to page, from article to article, etc., without changing our basic visual part.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><code>3LT Template (Frontpage)</code>: The 2nd level of our template. It can contain individual code (like <code>native blocks</code>), contain as many <code>efp</code>s as we want but cannot contain another <code>frontpage</code> or <code>front</code>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><code>3LT Template (EFP)</code> : The 3rd level of the template. can be integrated into the previous two as many times as we like.
        <code>CAUTION - BONUS</code> : The combination of the three layers can give enormous flexibility in the appearance of our components. E.g. we create two copies of the block with different settings and parameters and while the display position is the same, if the frontpage is different, we will have only one block displayed, while the other block will appear on the frontpage we set for it, when the page contains this the frontpage.
        E.g. in the program <code>articles</code> we define another <code>frontpage</code> and in the program <code>contacts</code> another, but both have display positions, e.g. the &quot;position1&quot;. Depending on which <code>frontpage</code> or <code>efp</code> we define in our block settings, the corresponding one will appear.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><code>View Position</code> : The display position of the block. Each part of 3LT Templates can have different display positions. These are usually created during the template installation process, but can be created later as well.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><code>View Order</code> : The order that will appear inside the <code>View Position</code>.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        </ol>

        <li>
        <p><code>Theme of appearance of Block</code>: We choose the appearance theme of the block. Each block has at least one default display theme named &quot;default&quot;. As one might aptly conclude, this option creates increased display potential.</p>
